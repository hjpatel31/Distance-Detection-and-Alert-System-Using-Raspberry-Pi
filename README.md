# Distance-Detection-and-Alert-System-Using-Raspberry-Pi
This project demonstrates a distance detection and alert system using a Raspberry Pi with an ultrasonic distance sensor, RGB LED, buzzer, and button for user control. The system continuously monitors the distance of objects within its range and provides both visual and auditory feedback based on the detected distance.
